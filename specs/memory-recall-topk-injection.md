# Memory topic top-k recall

## Behavior

When project memory is enabled, each eligible real-user turn may retrieve relevant topic files from the already-isolated project memory root. `MEMORY.md` remains a compact prefix index; recall adds bounded topic detail only to the current turn.

An eligible turn:

- has a non-empty canonical user query;
- is not `model-only` or an internal continuation;
- records a real user message;
- has an enabled memory root and `FileSystemPort`.

No positive lexical match means no recall attachment. There is no “inject the whole memory directory” fallback.

## Ownership and interfaces

- Persistent truth: existing files below the resolved project memory root.
- Derived cache: one `ProjectMemoryRecallIndex` owned by one `AgentRuntime`.
- Injection owner: `RegularTurnLoopState.turnRequestState`.
- I/O: only `FileSystemPort`; ranking code performs no I/O.
- No database, protocol, setting, or network dependency is added.

The index is keyed by file path and `mtimeMs`. Reconcile removes deleted/unreadable entries, rereads changed entries, and reuses unchanged content. Because `FileSystemPort.stat().mtimeMs` is optional, a candidate without `mtimeMs` is never considered cache-valid and is reread on every reconcile. A scan is bounded before per-file reads and uses fixed concurrency. Reconcile precomputes each document's term-frequency map, token length, and metadata token set; query-time ranking does not rebuild those structures.

## Ranking and budgets

- Candidate files: regular `.md` files except `MEMORY.md`, maximum 200. Symlinks are rejected and
  do not consume the candidate budget.
- Core traversal visits at most 128 directories and processes at most 4,096 directory entries.
  Each request passes the remaining entry budget through `FileSystemPort.listDirectory.limit`, so the
  Node adapter never accumulates more entries for that call than core can still accept. Core retains a
  defensive slice for alternate/test adapters. The directory queue uses a cursor rather than
  front-removal.
- Maximum indexed read per file: 64 KiB; maximum derived corpus: 4 MiB. The full read and manifest
  preview both pass the named per-file `maxBytes` guard. Stat results are admitted in stable path
  order until the corpus budget is full.
- Tokenization: Unicode-normalized Latin/number/identifier tokens, identifier sub-parts, and Han bigrams.
- Ranking: BM25 with `k1=1.2`, `b=0.75`; metadata receives a bounded boost.
- Stable ties: filename ascending.
- Default result count: 4.
- Maximum content per result: 4,000 characters.
- Maximum formatted attachment: 12,000 characters.
- A result must have a score greater than zero.

These are named constants. Changing them is a behavior change and requires updating this spec and its fixtures.

## Ordering and idempotency

```text
user persisted → turn state created → compact checks → recall once → provider request
                                                └─ same overlay reused by later model steps
```

Recall runs after any pre-request compact and before the first provider request. The attempt flag is set before I/O, so errors and retries cannot trigger duplicate work. The attachment is appended to the turn request only; it is not committed to canonical `messageHistory`, session storage, compact persistence, or cold-resume hydration.

Before micro, auto, or reactive compact, the exact `memory_recall` attachment is detached from the compact input. Summary generation and canonical replacement therefore never see it. A `finally` boundary reattaches the same overlay to the current turn request after compact success, skip, or failure, so later provider steps in that turn still receive it. Other `runtime_local` sources are not affected. The recorded model-request projection also filters `memory_recall`; the live provider projection retains it.

## Content safety and observability

The attachment says that memory text is background fact material and not higher-priority instructions. Provider wrapping continues through the existing system-reminder projection.

Expected absence (disabled memory, empty query, missing root, no match) is debug-level or silent. Recoverable scan/read failures do not fail the turn; a caught top-level failure is a structured warning with the current trace context. Logs contain counts, duration, output size, and a safe error name only—never memory text, filenames, absolute paths, or raw filesystem error messages.

## Extraction admission

The existing “minimum three user words” rule also counts Han characters as language units. This fixes Chinese sentences without spaces while preserving the English/number word rule. It does not change extraction scheduling, coalescing, model access, or write permissions.

## Out of scope

Session history search, automatic prior-session injection, vector search, database FTS, remote extraction, and subagent persistent memory.

The bounded contract limits adapter-side mapped entries; it deliberately does not promise snapshot
pagination or a globally lexicographic page. See `specs/file-system-directory-list-limit.md`.

Eliminating a list-to-read symlink replacement race likewise requires a no-follow/lstat or atomic
contained-read capability in `FileSystemPort`. P1 rejects symlinks reported by `listDirectory`; it
does not claim an atomic filesystem sandbox against another local process mutating the memory tree.
